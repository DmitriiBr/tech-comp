# Microfrontends

Here's a table comparing Module Federation and its alternatives for microfrontend solutions based on popularity, framework agnosticness, downloads, and easiness of use:

| Solution                                | Popularity                                            | Framework Agnosticness                                                             | Downloads (NPM Weekly)                   | Easiness of Use                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module Federation (Webpack\Vite\Rspack) | Very popular, industry standard with strong adoption  | Mostly tied to Webpack but evolving to support other bundlers like Rspack and Vite | Very high, millions of downloads overall | Powerful but can be complex to configure; requires understanding of Webpack and runtime sharing concepts |
| Native Federation (esbuild)             | Growing, alternative to Module Federation for esbuild | Framework agnostic, uses native ES modules and import maps                         | Moderate                                 | Easier setup than Webpack Module Federation, keeps modularity without webpack dependency                 |
| Single-SPA (runtime orchestration)      | Popular, widely used alternative to Module Federation | Framework agnostic, supports multiple frameworks                                   | Moderate                                 | Easier to set up and use, good documentation, but less dynamic code sharing than Module Federation       |
| Import Maps (native browser)            | Emerging, seen as a web-standard alternative          | True framework agnostic, browser native                                            | Low                                      | Very easy to use, but limited compared to full runtime code sharing and dependency resolution            |
| SystemJS (module loader)                | Less popular than Module Federation but stable        | Framework agnostic, works with any JS                                              | Low to moderate                          | Flexible but more manual config and runtime complexity                                                   |

Key notes:

- Module Federation is a strong choice for dynamic runtime sharing of code and dependencies but requires Webpack and can be complex to configure.
- Native Federation with esbuild is an emerging alternative that supports modern build tools beyond Webpack, emphasizing browser standards.
- Single-SPA focuses more on orchestration and lifecycle management but does not dynamically share code; itâ€™s easier for heterogeneous stacks.
- Import Maps provide a lightweight, native browser way to map modules but lack the full dependency sharing and version control of Module Federation.
- Nx simplifies Module Federation use within monorepos, improving developer experience and build performance.
- SystemJS is a lower-level module loader that's flexible but with trade-offs in complexity and adoption.

This comparison highlights how Module Federation remains the most robust and widely adopted solution for microfrontend module sharing, while alternatives provide trade-offs in simplicity, build tool support, and native capabilities.
